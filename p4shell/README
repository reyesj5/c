Only two functions seem to work for me:

gooduser_basic
gooduser_args

I didn't have enough time to test the rest:

gooduser_rd
gooduser_multipleCommand
buildin_wrongFormat
cd_toFolderNotExist
badCommand
complexCommand
multipleCommand
complexRedirection_format
advancedRedirection_format
complexRedirection_illegal
advancedRedirection_illegal
advancedRedirection_concat
emptyInput
1KCommand
